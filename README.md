## description

***
This application aims to organize the user's agenda and keep track of tasks through time in the form of a Note Taker. The user writes and saves notes as the saved entries can be accessed anytime. App's front end was given as a starter code and the newly created code handles the back end, connects the two, and then deploys the entire application to Heroku. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text; THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page<br>
* WHEN I click on the Save icon; THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes<br>
* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column; THEN that note appears in the right-hand column<br>
